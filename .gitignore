# Sensitive files
# NOTE: It is critical to ignore files that contain credentials.
# Your userservice/src/main/resources/application.properties contains database
# credentials, so it should be ignored or those details should be moved to
# environment variables outside of the repository.
# Ignoring it will require collaborators to set up their own local environment file.
